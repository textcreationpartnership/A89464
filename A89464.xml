            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>The firÅ¿t ObÅ¿ervation I am to make to you is this, that it is Å¿aid here, That <hi>His MajeÅ¿ty was enforc'd by tumults to leave the Parliament, and to goe from White-hall, and to withdraw himÅ¿elfe into thoÅ¿e courÅ¿es, which now he hath taken.</hi>

It is affirmed, <hi>that the Government of your City hath been mannaged by a few deÅ¿perate perÅ¿ons, and that they do exerciÅ¿e an arbitrary power.</hi>] In anÅ¿wer to which the two HouÅ¿es of Parliament gives you this teÅ¿timony, that you have in moÅ¿t of the great occaÅ¿ions concerning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the City, followed their direction, and that direction which they have given, and you have executed, they muÅ¿t &amp; will maintain to be Å¿uch as Å¿tands with their honor in giving it, and your truÅ¿t and fidelity in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it.</p>
                        <p>It is objected in the third place; <hi>That Contributions have been publickly made, for the maintenance of that Army which did joyne Battell with the King, and did by all the means that TreaÅ¿on and Malice could Å¿uggest, endeavour to take away His Life, and deÅ¿troy His IÅ¿Å¿ue.</hi>] To this I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to Å¿ay, That the deÅ¿ign of bringing up the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h Armies, the gathering together of the Cavaliers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>White-hall,</hi> the violent coming to the HouÅ¿e of Commons, the Kings going into the North, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing Armes there, are cleer evidences that violence was firÅ¿t intended, and divers practiÅ¿es were made againÅ¿t the Parliament, before they took any courÅ¿e, or made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preparation to take up arms for their defence; for the danger of His MajeÅ¿ties perÅ¿on they were Å¿orry for it, and did by divers humble Petitions labour to prevent it; And as touching the royall iÅ¿Å¿ue, they have Å¿ufficiently declar'd to the world, their good affections towards them, by the care they have taken both for the Å¿afety and maintenance of thoÅ¿e who are left here.</p>
                        <p>It is further expreÅ¿Å¿'d in this AnÅ¿wer; <hi>That the King demands the Lord Major, MaÅ¿ter Alderman</hi> Fowke, <hi>Colonell</hi> Ven, <hi>and Colonell</hi> Manwaring, <hi>to be delivered up as guilty of SchiÅ¿me and high TreaÅ¿on.</hi>] Concerning

                        <p>And I am further to tell you, that there is little cauÅ¿e for His MajeÅ¿ty to make this demand, conÅ¿idering that He HimÅ¿elf doth by force keep away many accuÅ¿ed in Parliament, as my Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> and many more impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of high TreaÅ¿on, beÅ¿ides divers others great Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, that Å¿tand charged there for hainous crimes, all which by force are kept from the due proceedings, and legall triall in Parliament.</p>
                        <p>It is alleaged in this AnÅ¿wer, That <hi>my Lord Maior, and thoÅ¿e other perÅ¿ons named, are countenancers of BrowniÅ¿ts, and AnabaptiÅ¿ts, and all manner of Sectaries.</hi>] To this I am commanded to Å¿ay, That hereof there is no proof; It doth not appear that they give any Å¿uch countenance to Sectaries of any kinde whatÅ¿oever; and if it did, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeÅ¿ty hath little reaÅ¿on to object it, while notwithÅ¿tanding

                        <p>It is affirmed, <hi>That mens perÅ¿ons have been impriÅ¿oned, and their houÅ¿es plunder'd, becauÅ¿e they will not rebell againÅ¿t His MajeÅ¿ty.</hi>] To this I am commanded to declare, that no mens houÅ¿es have been plunder'd by any direction of the Parliament, but that they have been very carefull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿train all Å¿uch violent courÅ¿es, Å¿o far as they were able; and that they have never committed any man, but Å¿uch men as by due information they conceived to be Å¿editious perÅ¿ons, and like to trouble the peace of the State.</p>
                        <p>It is objected further; <hi>That the Property of the Subject is deÅ¿troyed by taking away the twentieth part by an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power.</hi>] To this they Å¿ay, That that Ordinance it doth not require a twentieth part, but doth limit the AÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors, that they Å¿hall not go beyond a twentieth part; and that this is done by a power derived from both houÅ¿es of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; the Lords who have an hereditarie intereÅ¿t in making Laws in this Kingdom, and the Commons who are elected and choÅ¿en to repreÅ¿ent the whole body of the Comminalty, and truÅ¿ted for the good of the people, when ever they Å¿ee cauÅ¿e to charge the Kingdom: And they Å¿ay further, that the Å¿ame Law that did enable the two HouÅ¿es of Parliament to raiÅ¿e forces to maintain and defend the Å¿afety of Religion, and of the Kingdom, doth likewiÅ¿e enable them to require contributions, whereby thoÅ¿e forces may be maintained, or elÅ¿e it were a vaine power to raiÅ¿e forces, if they had not a power likewiÅ¿e to maintain them in that Å¿ervice for which they were raiÅ¿ed.</p>

And to this point I am commanded to adde this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anÅ¿wer, that there was little reaÅ¿on for this to be objected on his MajeÅ¿ties behalf, when it is well known that from the Å¿ubjects (which are within the power of his army) His MajeÅ¿ty doth take the full yeerly value of their Lands, and in Å¿ome caÅ¿es more that not only particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar houÅ¿es, but whole Towns have been plunder'd by command and deÅ¿ign; and that by Proclamations men are declared to forfeit all their eÅ¿tates, becauÅ¿e they will not obey Arbitrary Commands, and this is commonly practiÅ¿ed by His MajeÅ¿ty, and on his part, and therefore there was little reaÅ¿on to charge the Parliament with Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary and moderate a contribution as the twentieth part.</p>
                        <p>It is declared, <hi>That the King expects to be kept from Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Affronts.</hi>] Upon which, I am commanded to obÅ¿erve, that His MajeÅ¿ties expreÅ¿Å¿ions in His AnÅ¿wer tend to the making of a diviÅ¿ion in this City, and to the raiÅ¿ing of a party, which may make Å¿ome diÅ¿turbance in that orderly government which is now eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, both which will certainly prove equally deÅ¿tructive to him and both HouÅ¿es of Parliament; and more prejudiciall to his quiet abode here, then any thing that hath ever beene acted by the HouÅ¿es of Parliament, or the preÅ¿ent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the City.</p>
                        <p>They obÅ¿erve further that in this AnÅ¿wer, <hi>His MajeÅ¿ty doth profeÅ¿Å¿e that He will Å¿eize upon the eÅ¿tates of thoÅ¿e that Å¿hall contribute any thing towards the maintenance of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Army, and will put them out of His protection, and by His MiniÅ¿ters in forraign States, will take Å¿uch courÅ¿e, that they may be proceeded againÅ¿t as enemies; that is, deÅ¿troyed and Å¿poiled.</hi>] To which the LORDS and COMMONS do Declare, That this is an exceÅ¿Å¿e of rigour and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tice

                        <p>BeÅ¿ides theÅ¿e ObÅ¿ervations out of the AnÅ¿wer, I am to obÅ¿erve one out of a narrative that was received from the Common Councell, that the King did Declare that he would Å¿end Å¿ome meÅ¿Å¿engers here to obÅ¿erve your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the City, and what was done amongÅ¿t you, the Parliament have juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to doubt, that theÅ¿e will be meÅ¿Å¿engers of Å¿edition and trouble, and therefore deÅ¿ire you to obÅ¿erve them and find them out, and that they may know who they are.</p>
                        <p>I am for a concluÅ¿ion to commend to your conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that you Å¿ee by the proceedings to which the King is drawn by the ill councell now about Him, that Religion, the whole Kingdom, this glorious City, and the Parliament, are all in great danger, and that this danger cannot be kept off in all likelyhood, but by the Army that is now a foot, and that the Lords and Commons are Å¿o farre from being frighted by any thing that is in this AnÅ¿wer, that they have for themÅ¿elves and the Members of both HouÅ¿es declared a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution towards the maintenance of this Army, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but hope and deÅ¿ire, that you that have Å¿hew'd Å¿o much good affection in the former neceÅ¿Å¿ities of the State will be Å¿enÅ¿ible of your own, and of the condition of the whole Kingdom, and adde (to that which you have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

            <p>At the end of every period of this Speech, the applauÅ¿e was Å¿o great, that he was fain to reÅ¿t till Å¿ilence was again made; and at laÅ¿t (the Company ready to be diÅ¿Å¿olved) after Å¿ome pauÅ¿e and conÅ¿ultation with the Committee of Lords and Commons then preÅ¿ent, and by their direction (Å¿ilence being made) he cloÅ¿ed all with the words following:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Worthy Citizens, you have underÅ¿tood the Å¿enÅ¿e of both HouÅ¿es of Parliament, concerning my Lord Major here, and thoÅ¿e worthy Members of your City, that are demanded; you have heard the Parliament declare, that they will protect them in that which they have done by direction of both HouÅ¿es; and they expect that you Å¿hould expreÅ¿Å¿e it your Å¿elves likewiÅ¿e, that if any violence be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to them, you will Å¿ecure and defend them with your uttermoÅ¿t force; and you Å¿hall alwaies finde, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Parliament Å¿hall not onely extend to theÅ¿e, but to all others that have done any thing by their command.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Which words were no Å¿ooner uttered, but the Citizens with one joynt harmony of mindes and voices, gave Å¿uch an accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as would have drown'd all the former, if they had been then breathing, which after a long continuance reÅ¿olv'd it Å¿elf into this more articulate and diÅ¿tinct voice, <q>We will live and dye with them, We will live and dye with them,</q> and the like.</p>
            <p>So that in the managing of this dayes work, God was Å¿o plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed to manifeÅ¿t himÅ¿elf, that the well-affected went away not Å¿trengthened onely, but rejoycing; and the Malignants (as they

               <!-- PDF PAGE 48 -->have been called) Å¿ome convinced, others Å¿ilenced, many aÅ¿ham'd; it fully appearing how little power they had to anÅ¿wer their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ires of doing miÅ¿chief: whileÅ¿t in Å¿tead of dividing the City, they were exceedingly united; in Å¿tead of a diÅ¿Å¿ipation, thouÅ¿ands were unexpectedly brought (as it were) into an unthought of AÅ¿Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, to live and dye in the defence of theÅ¿e zealous and honorable AÅ¿Å¿ertors of their peace and liberties: All which we may Å¿umme up in that triumph of the man of God: <hi>In the thing wherein they dealt proudly, God was above them.</hi>
